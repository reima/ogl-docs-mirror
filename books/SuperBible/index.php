<P>The sixth edition of OpenGL&reg; SuperBible, the newest member of the Addison Wesley
OpenGL Technical Library, is now available!</P>

<P>
OpenGL® SuperBible, Sixth Edition, is the definitive programmer’s guide, tutorial, and
reference for the world’s leading 3D API for real-time computer graphics, OpenGL 4.3.
The best all-around introduction to OpenGL for developers at all levels of experience,
it clearly explains both the newest API and indispensable related concepts. You’ll find
up-to-date, hands-on guidance for all facets of modern OpenGL development on both
desktop and mobile platforms, including transformations, texture mapping, shaders, buffers,
geometry management, and much more.
</P>

<P>
Extensively revised, this edition presents many new OpenGL 4.3 features, including
compute shaders, texture views, indirect draws, and enhanced API debugging. It has
been reorganized to focus more tightly on the API, to cover the entire pipeline
earlier, and to help you thoroughly understand the interactions between OpenGL and
graphics hardware.
</P>
