<H2>The OpenGL Reference Pages</H2>

<P>The <A HREF="./man4/">reference pages for OpenGL 4.1</A> include complete descriptions of all OpenGL
commands contained in the Core Profile of the OpenGL 4.1 Specification.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="./man3/">reference pages for OpenGL 3.3</A> include complete descriptions of all OpenGL
commands contained in the Core Profile of the OpenGL 3.3 Specification.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="./manglsl/">reference pages for the OpenGL Shading Lanaguage (GLSL)</A> include 
descriptions of all OpenGL Shading Language built-in functions.</P>

The legacy <A HREF="./man/">OpenGL 2.1 reference pages</A> include descriptions of all OpenGL commands
contained in the OpenGL 2.1 Specification, including commands that have been deprecated and removed in
more modern versions of OpenGL (but are still included in compatibility profiles of OpenGL).
Also included are descriptions of GLU and GLX entry points.

<H2>Quick Reference Cards</H2>

<P>Several quick reference guides are available in PDF format from the links below. The quick reference guides
are fold-out annotated lists of the functions included in OpenGL, along with their parameters and other useful
information.</P>

<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.khronos.org/files/opengl41-quick-reference-card.pdf">OpenGL 4.1 Quick Reference Guide (including GLSL 4.10)</A></LI>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.khronos.org/files/opengl-quick-reference-card.pdf">OpenGL 3.2 Quick Reference Guide (including GLSL 1.50)</A></LI>
</UL>

<P> The <A TARGET="_new" HREF="http://www.opengl.org/registry/"> OpenGL API
and Extension Registry</A>, hosted outside of the SDK, contains the formal
Specifications for OpenGL and the OpenGL Shading Language, as well as
for companion APIs like GLX and GLU. Specifications are the authoritative
documents about how OpenGL is intended to work. They are also the most
difficult to read, being written primarily for OpenGL implementers,
not developers using OpenGL; so you may find the reference pages combined
with tutorials to be a better choice. </P>

<P> The Registry also contains specifications for extensions describing optional
features of OpenGL, and header files defining interfaces for extensions.
Extension specifications are written as supplements to the core OpenGL
Specification. Most new features are first introduced as extensions and
only later become part of a core OpenGL version, so using extensions is
important to staying current with the evolution of the API. </P>
