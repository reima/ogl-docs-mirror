The OpenGL Shading Language reference page sources have been upgraded to
Docbook5 and merged with the API reference pages. Please refer to
directory ../man4/ for the current, complete set of reference pages.

The old Docbook4 sources and XHTML Transitional output versions of the
Shading Language reference pages are available under docbook4/ for the
time being, although they are no longer being updated and will
eventually be removed. They are also available in Subversion history
prior to Feburary 10, 2014, and will remain available.
