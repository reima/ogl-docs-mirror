<p> The OpenGL Shading Language reference pages have been updated to HTML5 format and
relocated. You should only have reached this page from a stale search
engine link (these will eventually update), or a link or bookmark (which
you are encouraged to update, if possible).</p>

<p> If you are using a modern browser, wait to be redirected to the
new index page, or click <a href="../../man4/index.php">here</a>. </p>

<p> If you are are using Internet Explorer 8 or earlier versions of IE
which cannot properly display HTML5, and cannot upgrade to a modern
browser, click <a href="../docbook4/xhtml/gl_FragDepth.xml">here</a> for a cached
copy of the old page. Note that these old pages will not be updated and
will eventually be removed. </p>
