<P>The <A HREF="./man/">reference pages</A> (aka man pages) include complete descriptions of all OpenGL,
GLU, and GLX entry points. They cover in detail how to use the commands, all of the parameters you can 
pass in, and all of the error conditions to avoid.</P>

<P>The <A TARGET="_new" HREF="/sdk/libs/OpenSceneGraph/glsl_quickref.pdf">GLSL Quick Reference Guide</A> 
is a one-page PDF providing an instant reference of GLSL's data types, built-in variables and functions.</P>

<P> The <A TARGET="_new" HREF="http://www.opengl.org/registry/"> OpenGL API
and Extension Registry</A>, hosted outside of the SDK, contains the formal
Specifications for OpenGL and the OpenGL Shading Language, as well as
for companion APIs like GLX and GLU. Specifications are the authoritative
documents about how OpenGL is intended to work. They are also the most
difficult to read, being written primarily for OpenGL implementers,
not developers using OpenGL; so you may find the reference pages combined
with tutorials to be a better choice. </P>

<P> The Registry also contains specifications for extensions describing optional
features of OpenGL, and header files defining interfaces for extensions.
Extension specifications are written as supplements to the core OpenGL
Specification. Most new features are first introduced as extensions and
only later become part of a core OpenGL version, so using extensions is
important to staying current with the evolution of the API. </P>
