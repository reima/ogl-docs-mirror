This is where enduser documentation visible to the public through
www.opengl.org goes, including manual pages, tutorials, examples, links
to the Wiki, and anything else we want to put here.

Some of these directories (man, man3, man4, manglsl, mancommon) are also
configured to be visible through Subversion anonymous, readonly public
access. It's important that when a new man page directory is added,
webmaster@opengl.org be contacted to make it also available through
anonymous RO Subversion access.
