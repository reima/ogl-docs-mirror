Tutorials folder.

This is where OpenGL tutorials will go.  These are
instructional materials, often accompanied by
sample code, that walk the reader through the use
of an OpenGL API feature or rendering technique.

Also see the sdk/samples folder, which is where
we place sample code that is not accompanied by
instructional text.
