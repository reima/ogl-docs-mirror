<P>The <A HREF="./man/">reference pages</A> (aka man pages) include complete descriptions of all OpenGL,
GLU, and GLX entry points. They cover in detail how to use the commands, all of the parameters you can 
pass in, and all of the error conditions to avoid.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/">specifications</A> are useful as the most
authoratative documents about how OpenGL is intended to work. They are also the most difficult to
read, so you may find the reference pages combined with tutorials to be a better choice. Note that the 
specifications are currently hosted outside of the SDK itself.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.opengl.org/registry/">Extension Registry</A>, also outside of the SDK, 
contains extension specifications describing optional features of OpenGL. These documents are written
as supplements to the core OpenGL specifications above.</P>
